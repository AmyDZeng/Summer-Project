# Summer-Project

Jenny, help me add to this when you get a chance:
Git good practices:
-push frequently, and keep changes small.
-git commit comments should be in present tense, short and to the point
-never accept your own pull request
-when experimenting with a feature, make your own seperate branch to avoid slips
-When you are done with a branch, remove it. Keep the workspace clean.


If you have successfully cloned this repository, please do the following steps:
	-make a branch (name it "myBranch")
	-edit the README by adding your name in the provided area below
	-add README.txt to the Staging Area
	-commit the changes, use this as the commit message: "Add <myName> to Readme"
	-return to your "Master" branch and merge it with "myBranch"
	-push the changes to "Origin"

If you are having difficulties with any of the steps above, please contact either Kevin Fu or Jenny Kim
